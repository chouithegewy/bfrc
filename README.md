### BLIND FOLD RANDOM CHESS

```when I got half way through K&R in ~2019, the C bible, it said something like "now you know enough to make large programs...".
I started writing this program because it was something I could make I thought would be fun to play also. A lot you can do with variables, loops, and control flows!

I didn't have the technical knowledge to create an "artifical intelligence," but making the game to play
"blind fold" chess against a computer that makes only random legal moves would be and something that would be difficult, too! (for my chess skill anyway...)

So, thus was born BFC.c. A single GIANT monolith. I had a function that was 1500 lines, and it became hard to keep everything in my head. I split it up
into multiple files (headers, function definition, etc). And, kept at it. I implemented the same game in Kotlin and Python, as well, to learn a language.

Keep repeating the same idea. This is the latest iteration. With good things to come!```
